* US image and video **processing** + pre-processing (to serve as input to be fed to a CNN)

* CNN model: **COVID-19** detection (COVID-19 Lung US video detection) + "US video to M-mode US image" converter.

* Transfer Learning: **pneumonia** detection


Dislaimer: Ongoing project! After this very first prototype, the project will be assessed for its use in a project, between Madrid HUFA Hospital and Madrid URJC University, for instructing Guatemala and Peru physicians in COVID-19 detection.
